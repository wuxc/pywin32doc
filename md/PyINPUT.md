KEY\_EVENT: KeyDown, RepeatCount, VirtualKeyCode, VirtualScanCode, ControlKeyState
 

MOUSE\_EVENT: MousePosition, ButtonState, ControlKeyState, EventFlags
 

WINDOW\_BUFFER\_SIZE\_EVENT: Size
 

FOCUS\_EVENT: SetFocus
 

MENU\_EVENT: CommandId


#### Properties

  - int EventType

  - boolean KeyDown
    True for a key press, False for key release

  - int RepeatCount
    Nbr of repeats generated \(key was held down if &gt1\)

  - int VirtualKeyCode
    Device-independent key code, win32con\.VK\_\*

  - int VirtualScanCode
